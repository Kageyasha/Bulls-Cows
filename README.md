# Bulls-Cows
Simple console written in C++  
Goal is to find a specific isogram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)  
The specific isogram is currently hardcoded but is easy extendable.  
  
--  
Goal of the project is to get in touch with the c++ syntax(and unreal engine syntax e.g -> FText/FString instead of std::string or TMap)
